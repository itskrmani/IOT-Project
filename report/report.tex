\textbf{Guidelines:} Clearly describe the methodology followed in implementing the project. You can cover the following points:\\
1) The data sets that you have used (if you have used any)\\
2) What kind of pre-processing is done on the data, any exploratory data analysis\\
3) Details of different machine learning algorithms used, along with the parameters, loss functions, etc.\\
4) Details on the experimental setup you have used for the project.\\
5) Implementation details of your project, etc.\\

\section{Results}
\textbf{Guidelines:} In this section, provide the results from your project

\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\textbf{Guidelines:} This section covers an analysis of the results you have obtained and directions on future work like to improve the results or how to extend your project to cover some real IoT use-cases, etc. 

\section{Conclusion}
\textbf{Guidelines:} You need to conclude your report by briefly restating the project's proposed idea and summarising your findings and key takeaways from the project.  

\section{Individual Contributions}
